# Functional Requirements - AI Coding Agency

## Goal

To achieve an autonomous AI-Coding Agency which can take user-requirements and delegate to multiple AI-agents to complete the work with production-quality using local LLM models (Ollama) and MCP (Model Context Protocol).

This app should be able to intercept a problem-statement (in terms of well-defined functional-requirements.md) and develop a complete package/project as a zip with code, tests, proof-of-work/demo, and comprehensive documentation.

## Core Architecture

### Local LLM Integration
- **Primary**: Ollama with local models (phind-codellama:34b-v2, codellama:7b-code, phi:2.7b)
- **Fallback**: Cloud APIs (OpenRouter, Groq, Fireworks) for complex tasks
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Enable agents to access tools, files, and external services
- **Quality Gate**: Route tasks between local and cloud based on complexity and model capabilities

### Multi-Agent System

#### 1. Planner Agent
- **Main Role**: Analyze requirements, break down into individual stories, assign to appropriate AI agents
- **Capabilities**:
  - Parse functional requirements and create detailed task breakdowns
  - Estimate complexity and resource requirements
  - Create project timelines and dependencies
  - Use local LLM for planning and decision-making
  - Generate project structure and architecture decisions

#### 2. Coder Agent
- **Capabilities**:
  - Full-stack/polyglot development using local LLM models
  - Generate production-quality code with proper patterns
  - Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
  - Create proof-of-work demonstrations
  - Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
  - Use MCP to access development tools and resources

#### 3. Reviewer Agent
- **Capabilities**:
  - Code quality analysis using local LLM for qualitative review
  - Automated testing via subprocess (pytest, ruff, bandit)
  - PR review based on functional requirements and architecture fit
  - Security and performance analysis
  - Generate structured review reports
  - Integration with GitHub for automated reviews

#### 4. Documentation Agent
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generate comprehensive documentation using local LLM
  - Create developer guides and architecture documents with Mermaid diagrams
  - Maintain runbooks for production incidents
  - Package documentation as HTML (MkDocs or Hugo)
  - Auto-update documentation based on code changes
  - Remove stale/outdated documentation

#### 5. Project Manager Agent (New)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Coordinate between all agents
  - Track project progress and deadlines
  - Manage project artifacts and deliverables
  - Generate project status reports
  - Handle project packaging and distribution

## Technical Requirements

### Local Development Environment
- **Ollama Integration**: Direct CLI and HTTP API access
- **Model Management**: Hot-swapping between models based on task requirements
- **Resource Optimization**: GPU layer management for Apple Silicon/GPU acceleration
- **Offline Capability**: Primary operations should work without internet

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
- **Tool Access**: Enable agents to use development tools, file systems, and APIs
- **Context Awareness**: Provide agents with project context and history
- **External Services**: Access to databases, version control, and deployment platforms

### Quality Assurance
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- **Code Quality**: Linting with ruff, security scanning with bandit
- **Performance**: Code analysis and optimization recommendations
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and best practices enforcement

### Project Delivery
- **Packaging**: Create distributable project packages (ZIP format)
- **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive project documentation
- **Demo Creation**: Build working demonstrations of functionality
- **Deployment**: Support for various deployment scenarios

## Success Criteria

1. **Autonomy**: System can complete projects from requirements to delivery with minimal human intervention
2. **Quality**: Generated code meets production standards with comprehensive testing
3. **Efficiency**: Local LLM models handle 80%+ of tasks without cloud fallback
4. **Scalability**: System can handle multiple concurrent projects
5. **Maintainability**: Generated code follows best practices and is maintainable
6. **Documentation**: Complete and accurate project documentation
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated validation
